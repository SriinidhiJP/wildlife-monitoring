This project prototype aims to monitor and prevent wildlife intrusion, specifically focusing on wild boars in agricultural fields. Utilizing cameras for real-time footage, the system detects wild boar presence and triggers sound generators to emit dog barking sounds, deterring them from entering cultivated areas. Simultaneously, an alert message is promptly sent to the field owner, ensuring timely response and protection of crops.
